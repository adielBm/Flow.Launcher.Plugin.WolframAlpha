A [Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher) plugin to get short textual answers using [Wolfram|Alpha Short Answers API](https://products.wolframalpha.com/short-answers-api/documentation/).

> [!WARNING]
> This is an early version of the plugin, it may not work as expected. 

## Installation

Currently, the plugin is not available in the Flow Launcher plugin store. you can install it manually by running the following command in Flow Launcher:

```
pm install https://github.com/adielBm/Flow.Launcher.Plugin.WolframAlpha/releases/latest/download/Flow.Launcher.Plugin.WolframAlpha.zip
```

You have to get an **App ID** from https://developer.wolframalpha.com/access and set it in the plugin settings. (free access for up to 2,000 API calls per month), otherwise, the plugin will use the default API ID `DEMO`.
